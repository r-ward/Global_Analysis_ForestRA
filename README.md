# Global_Analysis_ForestRA
This repository holds scripts and data used in a global analysis of forest reproductive allocation, described in the manuscript Ward et al. (2025)

GlobalForestRA_analysis.r
- this script calls source scripts from the /Functions folder to run analyses and generate all figures in the main text

GlobalForestRA_SI.r
- note that the main analysis must be run first to create the data objects used in the SI scripts
- this script calls source scripts from the /Functions folder to generate all tables and figures in the SI

/Data
 - the file 'GlobalForestRA_data.csv' contains litterfall and soil data needed to run the main analysis 
 
/Functions
- functions are called in the main analysis and SI scripts to format data, fit models, and create plots and tables

/Output
- tables and figures generated in the above scripts are saved here

Ward et al., (2025), Forest age rivals climate to explain reproductive allocation patterns in forest ecosystems globally, in prep.
